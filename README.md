# Workout-Timer
Interval timer for workouts

This timer take three inputs from the user to create a interval timer for workouts.
This project is for anyone who exercises and needs to work with a interval timer.


This timer takes an input for the number of rounds, length of rest(at start of each round), and length of work for each round. 

This is my first project created without the assistance of a direct tutorial so please feel free to give criticism and feedback. 
I am still trying to figure out how to program and how to effectively use github so any insight is appreciated. 
thank you
